       "AIMessage(content=\"Victory Mansions is a building located in London, specifically in Airstrip One, which is the chief city of Oceania. It is a residential building complex where Winston resides. The building is described as having glass doors at the entrance. The hallway of Victory Mansions has a distinct smell of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. On one wall of the hallway, there is a large colored poster depicting the face of a man in his forties with a black mustache. \\n\\nThe flat in Victory Mansions is situated on the seventh floor. Winston, who is described as a small and frail figure wearing blue overalls, takes his time climbing the stairs due to his varicose ulcer. On each landing of the building, there is a poster with the face of Big Brother, which seems to follow you with its eyes. \\n\\nInside Winston's flat, there is a telescreen, which is an oblong metal plaque on the right-hand wall. The telescreen cannot be completely shut off and serves as a constant surveillance device. The flat also has a window. The living-room of the flat has a unique layout, with the telescreen positioned on the longer wall opposite the window. There is a shallow alcove next to the telescreen, which was likely intended for bookshelves. Winston often sits in this alcove to avoid being seen by the telescreen, although he can still be heard. \\n\\nOverall, Victory Mansions is a residential building complex in London, serving as the home for individuals living in Airstrip One.\")"
